      <strong>L</strong>anguage (HTML) is a type of markup language.[1] It is
      used to make webpages. Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and
      even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look
      like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is
      information about about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created
      the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information. HTML is often
      used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to
      change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can
      also change HTML and CSS. HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium
      (W3C). There are many versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current
      standard of HTML is called HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.
